  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    These German potato pancakes are a nice change from regular pancakes. They make a great dinner meal when served with
    Bratwurst sausage. I spread mine with cranberry sauce and top with maple syrup.
  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon pepper</li>
    <li>6 medium potatoes, peeled and shredded</li>
    <li>½ cup finely chopped onion</li>
    <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Beat eggs, flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl; stir in potatoes and onion.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Drop heaping tablespoonfuls of potato mixture into hot oil in
      batches. Press to flatten. Cook until browned and crisp, about 3 minutes on each side. Transfer to a paper
      towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining potato mixture.
    </li>
  </ol>
